2. Performance: Python3 is faster than Python2.
3. Backward compatibility: Python3 is backward compatible with Python2.
4. Libraries: Python3 has more libraries than Python2.

#? Python Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, //, **
2. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
3. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
4. Logical Operators: and, or, not

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. break statement
4. continue statement
5. pass statement
6. Combination of break and continue statements

#? Python Data Structures
1. Lists - mutable ordered collection of elements
    * Attributes: len(), index()
    * Operations: append(), remove(), sort()
2. 2D Lists - lists containing other lists
    * Attributes: len() (for rows), len(matrix1) (for columns)
    * Operations: indexing, slicing, modifying elements
3. Dictionaries - key-value pairs
    * Attributes: keys(), values(), items()
    * Operations: add key-value pair, remove key
4. Tuples - immutable ordered collection of elements
    * Attributes: count(), index()
    * Operations: concatenation
5. Sets - unordered collection of unique elements
    * Operations: add(), remove(), check membership
6. Strings - sequence of characters
    * Operations: upper(), lower(), count(), startswith(), endswith(), replace()

#? Python Functions
1. Functions - basic function definition and call
2. Lambda functions - concise anonymous functions
3. Recursive functions - functions calling themselves
4. Default arguments - providing default values for function parameters
5. Keyword arguments - passing arguments by name
6. args and kwargs - handling variable number of positional and keyword arguments
7. Scope in Python - global variables, local variables, and modifying variables in enclosing scopes

#? Object Oriented Programming in Python
1. Classes and Objects - defining classes and creating instances
2. Class Attributes, Methods and variables - using class-level attributes and methods
3. Constructors - initializing objects with init method
4. Constructor Overloading - simulating constructor overloading (Python doesn't support true overloading)
5. Inheritance and Polymorphism - creating base and derived classes, demonstrating polymorphic behavior
6. Abstraction and Encapsulation - hiding internal details and protecting data
7. Static Methods and Class Methods - using @staticmethod and @classmethod decorators
